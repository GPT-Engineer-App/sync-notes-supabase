# sync-notes-supabase

Start persisting notes in the "notes" table in Supabase. Each note has a "note" attribute with its content
Use their REST API (DO NOT use the @supabase/supabase-js package) and 
assume I have a supabase project with following properties: 
- Project URL: https://mnwefvnykbgyhbdzpleh.supabase.co
- ANON KEY: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1ud2Vmdm55a2JneWhiZHpwbGVoIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MTMyNzQ3MzQsImV4cCI6MjAyODg1MDczNH0.tnHysd1LqayzpQ1L-PImcvlkUmkNvocpMS7tS-hYZNg

Make sure that we sync all the following actions in Supabase:
- Creating notes
- Editing notes
- Deleting notes

This is an example response: 
[{"id":1,"created_at":"2024-04-23T13:01:36+00:00","note":"This is a test note"}]
